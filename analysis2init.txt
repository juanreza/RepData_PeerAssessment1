# Short answer- no. Long answer- If you work very hard you can attach this very raw data to the more processed train and test X data, but a subsequent steps calls on you to get rid of all the variables that are not to do with mean or standard deviation (worked out from the column names- the features) and you have no names for those columns so they go. Seems a lot easier just to not include them in the first place
